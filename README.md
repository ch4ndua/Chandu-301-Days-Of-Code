## What is #301DaysOfCode?
#301DaysOfCode is a challenge to code for 3 minutes and 1 second, daily, for 301 days. People are often more likely to stick to small habits with a low barrier to start.

The creator of #301DaysOfCode, [Benjamin Spak](https://github.com/benjaminspak), used this as a challenge to get a job. The community uses this challenge to code consistently with the goal of going from a code newbie to an employed developer (often times in web development). (You can read the original #301DaysOfCode repository's [README](original-README.md) to understand the original challenge.)

I have different goals. I have some prior programming experience, however, I want to use this challenge to code consistently to improve my skills and work on interesting projects.
